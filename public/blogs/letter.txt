Letters I’ll Never Send

love, regret, honesty

There are letters I’ve written a hundred times in my head. Some start with “Hey,” others with “I’m sorry.” Most never get past the first line.
I used to think if I just found the right words, people would understand what I meant — why I got angry, why I left, why I stayed quiet. But the truth is, sometimes the words aren’t the problem. Sometimes people just stop listening.

I’ve got messages saved in drafts, screenshots of conversations I couldn’t finish, and a folder full of photos I can’t bring myself to delete. I tell myself I’ve moved on, but memory has its own gravity — it keeps pulling you back to places you swore you’d never visit again.

There’s a letter for her — the girl I thought I’d spend forever with. I’d tell her that I still remember the way she laughed at the dumbest things, the way she supported me even when I was impossible to handle. I’d tell her that I wasn’t angry at her — I was angry at myself for not knowing how to love properly. But that letter? It’s staying here, between me and the echo of what we were.

There’s another letter for my parents. I don’t blame them anymore. They were just two humans trying to live through their own storms while raising a kid who was trying to understand the thunder. I used to think love meant perfection. Now I know love is just trying, even when you don’t get it right.

And then there’s a letter for my younger self. The kid who tried to act strong while the world fell apart around him. I’d tell him it’s okay to break, it’s okay to feel too much, and it’s okay to not be okay all the time. I’d tell him that one day, he’ll learn how to build things that don’t collapse — not buildings, but himself.

I don’t think I’ll ever send these letters. Not because I’m scared — but because I finally understand that not every feeling needs to be delivered. Some belong to silence. Some belong to time.

If someone ever reads this, I hope they realize it’s not about sadness. It’s about release.
Because maybe healing isn’t about rewriting the past — maybe it’s just learning to live peacefully with the words you never said.
