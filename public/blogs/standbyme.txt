Stand by Me isn’t just a movie to me — it’s a friend I made along my film journey. A friend I’ll never forget, a friend I’ll always think about, and one that will stay with me till the day I die.

I still remember the first night I watched it — just before Christmas in 2022. I was bored and scrolling through films to watch. I’d been deep into my Stephen King phase, exploring his works and their movie adaptations. That’s when I came across Stand by Me (1986), directed by Rob Reiner and based on King’s novella The Body.

At first, I actually thought it was that Doraemon movie with the same name. I didn’t research anything about it — and maybe that’s what made the experience even better. I just hit play.

And wow… just wow.
This movie isn’t just storytelling — it’s life on screen. The performances, the cinematography, the music — everything was top-notch. It felt raw, nostalgic, and beautifully simple. Four boys — Gordie, Chris, Teddy, and Vern — set out to find the body of a missing kid, but what they truly find is the meaning of friendship.

After finishing it, I couldn’t stop humming “Lollipop, Lollipop, oh Lolli, Lolli, Lolli…” It stuck in my head for days. Even now, I catch myself thinking about those characters and their journey — that one summer that changed their lives forever.

Later, I read Stephen King’s The Body, and it was just as powerful. But there’s something about Stand by Me that feels timeless. It’s more than a movie; it’s a mirror reflecting that part of us we sometimes forget — the reckless, innocent, loyal version of ourselves that only existed in childhood.

It reminded me of my own younger days — back in 2018, when I was in 8th grade. I was a menace then: fighting, skipping classes, lying, doing stupid things just for fun. But behind all that, it was all about one thing — my friends. Those moments, those laughs, those mistakes… they built who I am.

And when the film ended with that final line —

“I never had friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve years old. Jesus, does anyone?”

— it hit me straight in the heart. Because it’s true. No matter how far we go, some friendships never fade. They just stay there, in the back of our minds, like the echo of a summer long gone.
