The Boomerang Called Past

The past is like a boomerang.
If you know how to throw it, you can catch it safely — no harm done.
But if you don’t, it comes back fast and slices through you before you even see it coming. Sometimes it hits soft, sometimes it knocks your whole life upside down. There are days I swear even the boomerang itself looks at me and goes, “Oh no, man… you’re done.”

I honestly don’t know how I made it this far. But for the past two months, I’ve been studying myself like a subject — learning my weaknesses, my strengths, and the parts of me I didn’t even know existed. It’s been weirdly peaceful. I’ve started to enjoy loneliness, not in a sad way, but in a “finally breathing” kind of way.

Some nights I sit in silence and think — about who I was, who I became, and who I want to be.
Like everyone else, I’ve learned my share of lessons — the hard way. That’s probably why I’m writing this.

There was a time when I was completely wrecked. Depressed as hell. I used to daydream about having a time machine like Back to the Future, just to go back and fix everything.
But now… I get it.

Loneliness is a teacher.
It whispers things you can’t hear in a crowd. It tells you that you can’t change the past — but you can stop repeating it. You can’t rewrite old chapters, but you can make sure the next ones are worth reading.

These days, I don’t want to escape the past anymore.
I just want to understand it — so the next time that boomerang flies back, I’ll be ready to catch it, smile, and say,
“Nice try.”
